pip install selenium

& "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\selenium"

I haven't full tested the code yet, so there are some bugs. I haven't coded it past the "review and buy" part, so I will have to see when it comes to that time.
